## Run

Per default running it will create a web server on the port `3020`.
Open [http://localhost:3020](http://localhost:3020) with your browser to view the debug page.

### Configuration

Edit parameters in [`config.json`](./config.json) (use an editor that is aware of JSON schemas: [`config.schema.json`](./config.schema.json)).

### Node.js

1. [Install Node.js (`node` + `npm`)](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
2. Setup:

   ```sh
   # Install dependencies
   npm install
   # Compile TypeScript code to JavaScript in build directory and
   # copy additional resource files and compiled files to dist directory
   npm run build
   # Run compiled files (default port 3020 => http://localhost:3020)
   npm run start
   # Optionally you can change the port of the web server from the CL
   npm run start -- --port 3020
   ```

3. Development:

   ```sh
   # Check files (style guide, errors)
   npm run lint
   # Auto fix files (style guide, errors)
   npm run fix
   # Create documentation in docs directory
   npm run docs
   npx http-server -o docs -p 8000
   # Auto update server on change
   npm run dev -- --port 2222
   ```

### Docker

1. [Install Docker (`docker` + `docker-compose`)](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and start the docker daemon
   - Linux:
     1. Install (e.g. via `sudo pacman -S docker docker-compose`)
     2. Use `systemd` to start the service: `systemctl start docker`
     3. If it's not yet working create the docker group (if it does not exist): `sudo groupadd docker`
     4. Add your user to this group: `sudo usermod -aG docker $USER`
     5. Log in to the new docker group since the current shells may not yet "know" about being added to the docker group (alternatively run `newgrp docker`)
   - Windows:
     1. Install (e.g. via `winget install -e --id Docker.DockerDesktop`)
     2. Add the binaries to the PATH: `C:\Program Files\Docker\Docker\resources\bin`
     3. Start `Docker Desktop` to start the docker engine
2. Build container declared in a `Dockerfile` in the current directory: `docker build --tag express-docker .`
   - `docker build [OPTIONS] PATH`
   - `--tag list`: Name and optionally a tag in the "name:tag" format
   - Windows: In case there are line endings errors from copying files into a docker container you can convert all relevant files to the Linux line endings via e.g. `find . -type f -name '*.ts' -not -path '*/node_modules/*' -exec dos2unix {} +`
3. Run container: `docker run --publish 3020:3020 express-docker`
   - `docker run [OPTIONS] IMAGE [COMMAND] [ARG...]`
   - `--publish list`: Publish a container's port(s) to the host

You can view:

- the created images created with `docker images`
- the currently running containers and their IDs/ports/states with `docker ps`
- stop a running container with `docker stop $ID` (stop all of them via `docker ps -aq | xargs docker stop`)
- to inspect an image use the command `docker run --rm -it --entrypoint=/bin/bash $TAG`
  (in case the image has no `bash` you may have to add it in the `Dockerfile` e.g. `RUN apk add --no-cache bash`)
- to inspect a running container use the command `docker exec -t -i $ID /bin/bash`

If you are finished you can:

- stop the docker service: `systemctl stop docker`
- prune all docker caches: `docker system prune -a`

> Make sure that all files that should not be copied to the docker container are listed in the [`.dockerignore`](.dockerignore) file!

> The `Dockerfile` was inspired by a [geeksforgeeks.org article 'How to Dockerize an ExpressJS App?'](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-dockerize-an-expressjs-app/).

### Logs

The server logs are stored in `logs`.

To copy them out of a `docker` container run: `docker cp $ID:$LOG_DIR ./app_logs` (`$LOG_DIR=/app/logs/`).

## Dev

### Commands

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run check:circular` | Check for circular dependencies (uses `npx` since madge currently has security vulnerabilities) |
| `npm run check:exports` | Check for unused exports |
| `npm run fix` | Fix code style based on [`eslint` rules](.eslintrc.json) |
| `npm run lint` | Check code style based on [`eslint` rules](.eslintrc.json) and on `next` internals |
| `npm run test` | Run tests defined in [`src/tests`](src/tests) |

## Profiling

There are a number of ways to get a quick overview on what functions slow down the server:

> In case anonymous functions are used be careful since the can't be tracked by name (only line and file location)!
>
> ```ts
> // JS: *<anonymous> ./simulation/dist/lib/pathfinderOsm.js:37:101
> const noName = () => {};
> // JS: *haversineDistance ./simulation/node_modules/haversine-distance/index.js:17:28
> export function haversineDistance (a, b) {}
> // > or the JS syntax
> module.exports = haversineDistance
> ```

### Ticks

Based on [an article by `nodejs.org`](https://nodejs.org/en/learn/getting-started/profiling):

```sh
# Create a file that tracks everything going on in the interpreter
# > the output is stored in a file called 'isolate-0xnnnnnnnnnnnn-v8.log'
NODE_ENV=production node --prof .
# Using the tick processor bundled with the Node.js binary we can get a summary
node --prof-process isolate-0xnnnnnnnnnnnn-v8.log > processed.txt
```

```text
Statistical profiling result from isolate-0x55d5d3f55d60-31840-v8.log, (123205 ticks, 49227 unaccounted, 0 excluded).

### Flamegraph

Based on [the README of the GitHub project `davidmarkclements/0x`](https://github.com/davidmarkclements/0x?tab=readme-ov-file):

```sh
npx 0x .
```

When finished send a `SIGINT`/`SIGTERM` signal (`CTRL` + `C`) and then open the generated `flamegraph.html` in your browser.

> On some terminals this might not be possible via `CTRL` + `C` but you can always use for example `htop`, use the tree perspective and filter for `0x`, then send a `SIGTERM` to the parent `0x` process.

![Example flamegraph output of `0x`](./res/flamegraph_example.png)

### Docker Resource Monitor

There is an application called [`ctop`](https://github.com/bcicen/ctop) which can summarize live memory/CPU usage and network usage of a docker container.

### Benchmarks

There is a benchmarks that checks how fast the *shortest* path finding algorithm is (and also compares it to an algorithm that is not using the haversine distance as admissable heuristic).

To run the benchmark run `npm run bench`:

It can be observed that for random points (rerunning at least 50 times each computation) it takes in the most extreme cases on average 10ms to find a path.
This is on the larger map (which is the bounding box of Stuttgart) always faster than using a path finder without the heuristic.
On a small map the path finder without the heuristic is almost always faster most likely because it has not to deal with the overhead of the additional heuristic computation.
